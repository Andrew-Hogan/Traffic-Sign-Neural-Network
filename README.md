## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report


See traffic_sign_classifier_py.py for a cleaned version of this project code.
